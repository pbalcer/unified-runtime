## Building

Project is defined using [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

**Windows**:

Generating Visual Studio Project.  EXE and binaries will be in **build/bin/{build_config}**

~~~~
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake {path_to_source_dir} -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
~~~~

**Linux**:

Executable and binaries will be in **build/bin**

~~~~
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake {path_to_source_dir}
$ make
~~~~

**General**:

If you've made modifications to the specification, you can also run a custom `generate` target prior to building.
~~~~
$ make generate
~~~~

This call will automatically generate the source code.
