 Introduction

Objective
=========

The objective of the oneAPI Unified Runtime is to provide a unified interface to
device agnostic runtimes such as DPC++ across a wide variety of software platforms. The unified
runtime provides extensibility where new backends can be developed to support
new software platforms and devices. Software platforms can be enumerated through the interface
and used to provide best experience. The interface will semantically align with the Level Zero
Driver interface and support native platform access.

Fundamentals
============

The following section provides fundamentals of the API design.
For more detailed information, refer to the programming guides and detailed specification pages.

* Coming soon

Terminology
-----------

This specification uses key words based on `RFC2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`__ to indicate requirement level.
In particular, the following words are used to describe the actions of an implementation of this specification:

  - **May** - the word *may*, or the adjective *optional*, mean that conforming implementations are permitted to, but need not behave as described.
  - **Should** - the word *should*, or the adjective *recommended*, mean that there could be reasons for an implementation to deviate from the behavior described, but that such deviation should be avoided.
  - **Must** - the word *must*, or the term *required* or *shall*, mean that the behavior described is an absolute requirement of the specification.

Naming Convention
-----------------

The following naming conventions must be followed:

## --validate=off
  - All functions must be prefixed with `${x}`
  - All functions must use camel case `${x}ObjectAction` convention
  - All macros must use all caps `${X}_NAME` convention
  - All structures, enumerations and other types must follow `${x}_name_t` snake case convention
  - All structure members and function parameters must use camel case convention
  - All enumerator values must use all caps `${X}_ENUM_ETOR_NAME` convention
  - All handle types must end with `handle_t`
  - All descriptor structures must end with `desc_t`
  - All property structures must end with `properties_t`
  - All flag enumerations must end with `flags_t`
## --validate=on

The following coding conventions must be followed:

  - All descriptor structures must be derived from `${x}_base_desc_t`
  - All property structures must be derived from `${x}_base_properties_t`
  - All function input parameters must precede output parameters
  - All functions must return ${x}_result_t

Versioning
----------

There are multiple versions that should be used by the application to determine compatibility:

**Platform Version** - this is the version of the API supported by the platform.

  - This is typically used to determine if the device supports the minimum set of APIs required by the application
  - There is a single 32-bit value that represents an entire collection of APIs
  - The value is encoded with 16-bit Major and 16-bit Minor parts
  - Major version increment consist of modified functionality, including deprecate features, and may break backwards-compatibility
  - Minor version increment consist of additional functionality, including promoted extensions, and must retain backwards-compatibility
  - The value is determined from calling ${x}PlatformGetApiVersion
  - The value returned will be the minimum of the ${x}_api_version_t supported by the device and known by the driver

Error Handling
--------------

The following design philosophies are adopted to reduce Host-side overhead:

  - By default, the driver implementation may not perform parameter validation of any kind

    + This should be handled by validation layer(s)

  - By default, neither the driver nor device provide may provide any protection against the following:

    + Invalid API programming
    + Invalid function arguments
    + Function infinite loops or recursions
    + Synchronization primitive deadlocks
    + Non-visible memory access by the Host or device
    + Non-resident memory access by the device

  - The driver implementation is **not** required to perform API validation of any kind

    + The driver should ensure well-behaved applications are not burdened with the overhead needed for non-behaving applications
    + Unless otherwise specified, the driver behavior is undefined when APIs are improperly used
    + For debug purposes, API validation can be enabled via the loader's validation layer(s)

  - All API functions return ${x}_result_t

    + This enumeration contains error codes for the Level Zero APIs and validation layers
    + This allows for a consistent pattern on the application side for catching errors; especially when validation layer(s) are enabled

Multithreading and Concurrency
------------------------------

The following design philosophies are adopted in order to maximize Host thread concurrency:

  - APIs are free-threaded when the runtime's object handle is different.

    + the runtime should avoid thread-locks for these API calls

  - APIs are not thread-safe when the runtime's object handle is the same, except when explicitly noted.

    + the application must ensure multiple threads do not enter an API when the handle is the same

  - APIs are not thread-safe with other APIs that use the same runtime's object handle

    + the application must ensure multiple threads do not enter these APIs when the handle is the same

In general, the API is designed to be free-threaded rather than thread-safe.
This provides multithreaded applications with complete control over both threading and locks.
This also eliminates unnecessary runtime overhead for single threaded applications and/or very low latency usages.

The exception to this rule is that all memory allocation APIs are thread-safe since they allocate from a single global memory pool.
If an application needs lock-free memory allocation, then it could allocate a per-thread pool and implement its own sub-allocator.

An application is in direct control over all Host thread creation and usage.
The runtime should never implicitly create threads.
If there is a need for an implementation to use a background thread, then that thread should be created and provided by the application.

Each API function must document details on the multithreading requirements for that call.

The primary usage-model enabled by these rules is:

  - multiple, simultaneous threads may operate on independent driver objects with no implicit thread-locks
  - driver object handles may be passed between and used by multiple threads with no implicit thread-locks

Application Binary Interface
----------------------------

## --validate=off
The Unified Runtime C APIs are provided to applications by a shared import library.
C/C++ applications must include "${x}_api.h" and link with "${x}_api.lib".
The Unified Runtime C Device-Driver Interfaces (DDIs) are provided to the import library by the shared loader or runtime and driver libraries.
C/C++ loaders and drivers must include "${x}_ddi.h".
## --validate=on

The implementation of these libraries must use the default Application Binary Interface (ABI) of the standard C compiler for the platform.
An ABI in this context means the size, alignment, and layout of C data types; the procedure calling convention.
and the naming convention for shared library symbols corresponding to C functions. The ABI is backward-compatible
for API minor version increments such as adding new functions, appending new enumerators, and using reserved
bits in bitfields. ABI is not guaranteed to be backward-compatible for API major version increments such as
modifying existing function signatures and structures, removing functions and structures, etc.

## --validate=off
On platforms where Unified Runtime is provided as a shared library, library symbols beginning with "${x}", "${x}t" or "${x}s"
and followed by a digit or uppercase letter are reserved for use by the implementation.
## --validate=on
Applications which use Unified Runtime must not provide definitions of these symbols.
This allows the Unified Runtime shared library to be updated with additional symbols for new API versions or extensions without causing symbol conflicts with existing applications.

Tracing
---------------------

Unified Runtime loader implements tracing support through the `XPTI framework <https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/xptifw/doc/XPTI_Framework.md>`__.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Specific environment variables can be set to control the behavior of unified runtime or enable certain features.

.. envvar:: UR_ADAPTERS_FORCE_LOAD

   Holds a comma-separated list of library names used by the loader for adapter discovery. By setting this value you can
   force the loader to use specific adapter implementations from the libraries provided.

   .. note::

    This environment variable should be used for development and debugging only.

.. envvar:: UR_ENABLE_VALIDATION_LAYER

   Holds the value '0' or '1'. By setting it to '1' you enable validation layer.

   .. note::

    This environment variable should be used for development and debugging only.

.. envvar:: UR_ENABLE_PARAMETER_VALIDATION

   Holds the value '0' or '1'. By setting it to '1' you enable parameter validation for Unified Runtime API calls.

   .. note::

    This environment variable should be used together with "UR_ENABLE_VALIDATION_LAYER".
